**MAB Info**:
> MAB is a bot that I wanted to create to test my skills as a professional programmer, most if not all of the commands in this bot are backed up with tons and tons of code, for example the poll and remindme commands have fallback code, that make sure the bot doesnt flunk out and not deliver the response it was supposed to. As far as bot support goes, I'm on discord quite often and by using the b!report command I will see it within 12 hours at most.

> Prefix: b!
