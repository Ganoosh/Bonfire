#### Author Information

**Bonfire** is a bot that I wanted to create to test my skills as a professional programmer.\
Most if not all of the commands in this bot are backed up with tons and tons\
of code, for example the poll and remindme commands have fallback code, that make  
sure the bot doesnt flunk out and not deliver the response it was supposed to.
